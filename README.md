### This repository is about all data science concepts and projects
## What is data science?
> Data science is study of data to extract insights for business.It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.
## What is data science used for?
- Descriptive analysis
- Diagnostic analysis
- Predictive analysis
- Prescriptive analysis

## What is data?
> Data is collection of information. Data can be anything like text, image,video ,sounds.There can be existing data or data being aquired.

## What are the techniques used in Data science
> Different techniques are use in data science
- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering

### 1.Business Problem Understanding
> To solve any business problem, first we should understand the problem.At this stage asking questions related to project problems, and expectations.
### 2.Data Collection
### 3.Data cleaning and preparation
### 4.Exploratory data analysis
> Exploratory data analysi(EDA) is used in the field of data science to analyse and invetigate the dataset to find out the main characteristics of the data.
> The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions.
