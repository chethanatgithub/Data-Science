### This repository is about all data science concepts and projects
## What is data science?
> Data science is study of data to extract insights for business.It is a multidisciplinary approach that combines principles and practices from the fields of mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence, and computer engineering to analyze large amounts of data. This analysis helps data scientists to ask and answer questions like what happened, why it happened, what will happen, and what can be done with the results.
## What is data science used for?
- Descriptive analysis
- Diagnostic analysis
- Predictive analysis
- Prescriptive analysis

## What is data?
> Data is collection of information. Data can be anything like text, image,video ,sounds.There can be existing data or data being aquired.

## What are the techniques used in Data science
> Different techniques are use in data science
- Classification
- Regression
- Clustering

### 1.Business Problem Understanding
> To solve any business problem, first we should understand the problem.At this stage asking questions related to project problems, and expectations.
### 2.Data Collection
> Collecting necessary data required for EDA
### 3.Data cleaning and preparation
> Cleaning of data like filling missing values, removing duplicates,rectifying redundancy etc.
### 4.Exploratory data analysis
> Exploratory data analysi(EDA) is used in the field of data science to analyse and invetigate the dataset to find out the main characteristics of the data.
> The main purpose of EDA is to help look at data before making any assumptions.

### 6.Machine Learning
> Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
### 7.Model Evaluation  
> Model evaluation is the process of using different evaluation metrics to understand a machine learning model's performance, as well as its strengths and weaknesses.
### 8.Data Visualization
> Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.
